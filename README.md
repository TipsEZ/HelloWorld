# HelloWorld
My random programs while learning and fine tuning my programming skills.
When I first created my Github, I had some basic experience with C++ and Arduino,
now I am working to learn C#, Java, and Python. I am open to any feedback anyone 
may have as I embark upon this journey. I'm really hoping to develop a well rounded
set of examples that I can showcase for professional (if I didn't spell that 
correctly, please remember... I'm an engine ear) development.

**If you're wondering about the layout of my Readme, it is formatted this way so that
I can read everything with the browser only taking up half the screen.
